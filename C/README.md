# C Programming – Study and Practice

This folder contains my learning materials and practice work for the C programming language.

## Main Resources

- 📘 *C Programming: A Modern Approach* – K. N. King (2nd ed.)
- 📘 *C How to Program* – Deitel (9th ed.) [for SEI CERT C references]
- 🌐 [Exercism C track](https://exercism.org/tracks/c)

## Folder Structure

- `king-book/` – Exercises organized by chapter from K. N. King's book.
- `deitel-ref/` – Code snippets or insights referencing secure coding practices.
- `projects/` – Small C projects or utilities (e.g. `.txt` analyzers, command-line tools).

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in procedural programming.
- Learn to write clean, modular, and secure C code.
- Understand memory management and pointer manipulation.
- Document and version code professionally using Git.

## Commit Style

- Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., `feat: add chapter 2 exercises`)
- Include comments in the code for clarity
- Prefer small, focused commits

Happy coding! 🚀
